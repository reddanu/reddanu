# Guidelines for using the `.chr_meta` folder

The `.chr_meta` folder is a safe location to store project files for development and management that should not trigger pipeline builds. Examples of files to include are:

- **Testing & Design**: Test data, mock services, mockups, and branding.
- **Backup & Tools**: Old versions, backups, dev scripts, and utilities.
- **Project Management**: Task lists and roadmaps.
